# classifying-flowers
I created a simple machine learning project for classifying iris flowers using logistic regression, implemented with NumPy and visualized with Matplotlib. This project will use the classic Iris dataset to classify flowers into two classes (Setosa vs. Versicolor) based on petal length and width.
This project includes:

Loading the Iris dataset and selecting two features (petal length and width)
Implementing logistic regression using gradient descent
Defining a sigmoid function for binary classification
Predicting classes and visualizing the decision boundary
Calculating classification accuracy
